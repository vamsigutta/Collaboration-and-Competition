You are welcome to use this coding environment to train your agent for the project.  Follow the instructions below to get started!

### 1. Start the Environment

Run the next code cell to install a few packages.  This line will take a few minutes to run!


```python
!pip -q install ./python
```

    [31mtensorflow 1.7.1 has requirement numpy>=1.13.3, but you'll have numpy 1.12.1 which is incompatible.[0m
    [31mipython 6.5.0 has requirement prompt-toolkit<2.0.0,>=1.0.15, but you'll have prompt-toolkit 2.0.10 which is incompatible.[0m


The environment is already saved in the Workspace and can be accessed at the file path provided below. 


```python
from unityagents import UnityEnvironment
import numpy as np

env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="/data/Tennis_Linux_NoVis/Tennis")
```

    INFO:unityagents:
    'Academy' started successfully!
    Unity Academy name: Academy
            Number of Brains: 1
            Number of External Brains : 1
            Lesson number : 0
            Reset Parameters :
    		
    Unity brain name: TennisBrain
            Number of Visual Observations (per agent): 0
            Vector Observation space type: continuous
            Vector Observation space size (per agent): 8
            Number of stacked Vector Observation: 3
            Vector Action space type: continuous
            Vector Action space size (per agent): 2
            Vector Action descriptions: , 


Environments contain **_brains_** which are responsible for deciding the actions of their associated agents. Here we check for the first brain available, and set it as the default brain we will be controlling from Python.


```python
# get the default brain
brain_name = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[brain_name]
```

### 2. Examine the State and Action Spaces

Run the code cell below to print some information about the environment.


```python
# reset the environment
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]

# number of agents 
num_agents = len(env_info.agents)
print('Number of agents:', num_agents)

# size of each action
action_size = brain.vector_action_space_size
print('Size of each action:', action_size)

# examine the state space 
states = env_info.vector_observations
state_size = states.shape[1]
print('There are {} agents. Each observes a state with length: {}'.format(states.shape[0], state_size))
print('The state for the first agent looks like:', states[0])
```

    Number of agents: 2
    Size of each action: 2
    There are 2 agents. Each observes a state with length: 24
    The state for the first agent looks like: [ 0.          0.          0.          0.          0.          0.          0.
      0.          0.          0.          0.          0.          0.          0.
      0.          0.         -6.65278625 -1.5        -0.          0.
      6.83172083  6.         -0.          0.        ]


### 3. Take Random Actions in the Environment

In the next code cell, you will learn how to use the Python API to control the agent and receive feedback from the environment.

Note that **in this coding environment, you will not be able to watch the agents while they are training**, and you should set `train_mode=True` to restart the environment.


```python
for i in range(5):                                         # play game for 5 episodes
    env_info = env.reset(train_mode=False)[brain_name]     # reset the environment    
    states = env_info.vector_observations                  # get the current state (for each agent)
    scores = np.zeros(num_agents)                          # initialize the score (for each agent)
    while True:
        actions = np.random.randn(num_agents, action_size) # select an action (for each agent)
        actions = np.clip(actions, -1, 1)                  # all actions between -1 and 1
        env_info = env.step(actions)[brain_name]           # send all actions to tne environment
        next_states = env_info.vector_observations         # get next state (for each agent)
        rewards = env_info.rewards                         # get reward (for each agent)
        dones = env_info.local_done                        # see if episode finished
        scores += env_info.rewards                         # update the score (for each agent)
        states = next_states                               # roll over states to next time step
        if np.any(dones):                                  # exit loop if episode finished
            break
    print('Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: {}'.format(np.mean(scores)))
```

    Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: -0.004999999888241291
    Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: -0.004999999888241291
    Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: -0.004999999888241291
    Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: -0.004999999888241291
    Total score (averaged over agents) this episode: -0.004999999888241291


When finished, you can close the environment.


```python
# env.close()
```

### 4. It's Your Turn!

Now it's your turn to train your own agent to solve the environment!  A few **important notes**:
- When training the environment, set `train_mode=True`, so that the line for resetting the environment looks like the following:
```python
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]
```
- To structure your work, you're welcome to work directly in this Jupyter notebook, or you might like to start over with a new file!  You can see the list of files in the workspace by clicking on **_Jupyter_** in the top left corner of the notebook.
- In this coding environment, you will not be able to watch the agents while they are training.  However, **_after training the agents_**, you can download the saved model weights to watch the agents on your own machine!

### Model architecture
Similar to single-agent Actor Critic architecture, each agent has itâ€™s own actor and critic network. The actor network takes in the current state of agent and output a recommended action for that agent. However the critic part is slightly different from ordinary single-agent DDPG. Here the critic network of each agent has full visibility on the environment. It not only takes in the observation and action of that particular agent, but also observations and actions of all other agents as well. Critic network has much higher visibility on what is happening while actor network can only access to the observation information of the respective agent. The output of the critic network is, nevertheless, still the Q value estimated given a full observation input(all agents) and a full action input(all agents). The output of the actor network is a recommended action for that particular agent.
